                  INTRODUCTION
Our CPU Scheduler Visualization Project is a web-based interactive tool we developed to simulate and visualize how various CPU scheduling algorithms operate. The goal of this project is to help students, educators, and learners understand the effects of different scheduling strategies on process execution, waiting time, turnaround time, and CPU efficiency. 
We used Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as our main development environment and implemented the project using JavaScript. For the user interface, we built everything on the web, making it accessible, responsive, and easy to interact with directly from a browser.
We created this project to turn theoretical scheduling concepts into a more visual, intuitive, and hands-on experience. By building it on the web, we made it easily accessible to anyone with a browserâ€”no installation required. Our use of JavaScript helped us make the simulation dynamic and interactive, while VS Code allowed us to efficiently code and manage the entire project.

                OUR PROJECT FEATURES
-Web-based Gantt Chart Visualizations to show how processes are scheduled over time.
-Custom Input Fields for users to enter arrival time, burst time, priorities, and more.
-Live Calculation of Metrics, including average waiting time, turnaround time, and CPU utilization.
-Interactive Controls to start, pause, or step through simulations.
